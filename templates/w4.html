<div class="desc">
  We open on the front porch of a suburban home. The front door is pale pink with a brass knob and brass mail slot. A
  welcome mat reads, “Welcome!” in a cheery font. A man steps up to the door. He’s wearing navy blue coveralls and a
  worn baseball cap. On his chest, embroidered in the same florid font as the welcome mat, is the name Randall. The man
  sighs, shakes his head, inhales, looks up at the whitewashed slats of the porch roof, exhales slowly, rolls his
  shoulders back, blinks protractedly, sighs again, and rings the doorbell. After exactly five seconds, the door opens.
  <br><br>
  WOMAN: Oh! Hello. Uh, how’re you?
  <br><br>
  RANDALL: Uh, yeah. Fine. Good. Yeah. Thanks. And you?
  <br><br>
  WOMAN: Good, yeah.
  <br><br>
  RANDALL: …
  <br><br>
  WOMAN: Um, can I help you?
  <br><br>
  RANDALL: Well, yeah, the… thing is… Right. My name is Randall and I, uh, work for Appliances You Need. And, well, I
  was wondering if there are any appliances that you need and… and if there are then maybe you’d want an Appliances You
  Need appliance?
  <br><br>
  WOMAN: I suppose our toaster is a little burnt out… But we really try to support small business in our home. I’m not
  sure I feel comfortable buying products from big companies. We bought our microwave from Essential Microwaves
  eighteen years ago and haven’t yet seen a dip in hertz.
  <br><br>
  RANDALL: Hertz donut.
  <br><br>
  WOMAN: Sorry?
  <br><br>
  RANDALL: I, uh, it’s a joke—it—like, “Hurts, don’t it?”—I—Never mind. So, do you want the, uh, toaster? It has
  Personal Dial Settings. ‘No more over- or under-done breakfasts.’
  <br><br>
  WOMAN: Oh. I don’t know. We’d really rather buy our toasters from Unequivocally Necessary and Undeniably Local
  Toasters. It’s nothing against your company, but we really don’t care for the big brands. I’m sorry.
  <br><br>
  RANDALL: You could try, well, yeah, I guess… Yeah, okay. I—here, if you ever need—if you change my—your—mind, here’s
  my business card. You can call me.
  <br><br>
  WOMAN: Oh. Thanks. And your—Oh, it says here. Randall Scribbs.
  <br><br>
  RANDALL: Yeah, that’s me—my name.
  <br><br>
  WOMAN: Randall. Randy?
  <br><br>
  RANDALL: I’d really rather—
  <br><br>
  WOMAN: No? Okay. Well, bye then, Randall. You have yourself a nice day. I’ll call you if we change our mind.
  <br><br>
  (The door closes.)
  <br><br>
  RANDALL: …Bye.
