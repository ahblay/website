      Welcome to this website. On it you will find some of my programming and math projects, and some strange pieces of
      writing that I've done over the years. If the creative genius of the writing fails to attract you, please refrain
      from judgment, as doing so will crush my fragile ego. As time moves on and we march steadily towards Earth's
      imminent and inevitable ecological apocalypse, I may continue to add other forms of content to this site. Perhaps
      an album of photos of Antarctica (before its ice sheets have melted and flooded our coastal cities) or some
      sketches and drawings (as we may as well enjoy art before we are subsumed into a fiery hellscape). I would like to
      even include some interactive and educational articles, perhaps in a futile effort to color our otherwise bleak
      future with some shades of optimism. Above all, however, this site seves as a marketing tool, so if you like my
      work and need to hire a programmer/math guy who's concerned about the current state of the earth, please reach
      out.
      -->
      This website contains examples of my programming work, mathematical writing, mathematical
      tutorials, and some regrettably odd pieces of writing. (I also made this website from scratch. No Squarespace,
      no Wix, no Wordpress. Just good ol' fashioned HTML and CSS and banging my head against flex-box and weeping
      until I run out of tears.)

      You've probably heard this before from the computer programmer/mathematical/analytically-minded set, but my
      goodness, do I enjoy solving problems.
      <br><br>
      I suppose it started pretty early, with an obsessive interest in children's puzzle books, Snap Circuits and
      electronic and engineering kits. I remember (oh, the nerdiness of it!) asking my parents to write algebra problems
      on paper napkins at restaurants so I could exhibit my burgeoning mathematical prowess (as I saw it). My
      grandfather is an electrical engineer, and we would always share little mathematical puzzles with each other.
      [A lovely example of one such problem: What is the sum of all the individual digits used when writing down every
      number from 1 to 1,000,000?]
      <br><br>
      In university, these analytical tendencies drove me to study mathematics and eventually to a semester abroad in
      Hungary with the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program, which I found to be equal parts challenging and
      rewarding. My studies culminated in a deep dive mathematical exploration of the children's game of Dots-and-Boxes,
      a game whose analysis requires orders of magnitude more computational power than chess. It was my struggle with
      this problem that motivated my decision to learn more deeply about computer programming and software development.
      <br><br>
      After graduating from university, I spent the better half of a year simultaneously learning web development and
      designing a web application intended to solve the scheduling challenges faced by restaurants and other mid-sized
      businesses. This application used linear programming to automatically optimize the scheduling process, and
      rendered the resultant schedule to HTML. Admittedly, as this project's development ran concurrent with my
      learning of software technologies, its first iteration contained a good deal of bugs and errors. However, this
      initial foray taught me how to effectively design and create robust full-stack web applications, and a
      beta-version of the scheduler is currently in the pipeline. This edition is structured as an API with a simple
      frontend that allows users to upload their schedule data as a CSV file. The data is parsed into JSON and loaded
      into a PostgreSQL database, where it is available for processing into a schedule (using PuLP), and subsequent
      rendering back to CSV, where it can be loaded into Excel and edited by a user. This construction, in keeping with
      the REST design approach, is much more modular and greatly simplifies the task of writing unit tests.

      Ah, I see you want more information about me. Well, here it is. Please don't use it nefariously.
      <br><br>
      I am a programmer and math tutor living in Vancouver, BC. I studied at Quest University Canada in Squamish, where
      I received a Bachelor's of Arts and Sciences with a focus in mathematics. At Quest, students center their education
      on a question of their choosing; I asked, "How can I make simple things complicated?"
      <br><br>
      We are surrounded by simple things. Bread seems pretty simple. Lighters are simple. The patterns in linoleum or
      wallpaper are simple. I like to see what kind of complexity can be derived from the simple things. What makes the
      air bubbles in bread? Why does the flame on a lighter initially seem to jump up when lit? How are the patterns of
      wallpaper fundamentally similar or different?
      <br><br>
      I find there's a lot to be learned from exploring the hidden intricacies of things.
      <br><br>
