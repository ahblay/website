      Welcome to this website. On it you will find some of my programming and math projects, and some strange pieces of
      writing that I've done over the years. If the creative genius of the writing fails to attract you, please refrain
      from judgment, as doing so will crush my fragile ego. As time moves on and we march steadily towards Earth's
      imminent and inevitable ecological apocalypse, I may continue to add other forms of content to this site. Perhaps
      an album of photos of Antarctica (before its ice sheets have melted and flooded our coastal cities) or some
      sketches and drawings (as we may as well enjoy art before we are subsumed into a fiery hellscape). I would like to
      even include some interactive and educational articles, perhaps in a futile effort to color our otherwise bleak
      future with some shades of optimism. Above all, however, this site seves as a marketing tool, so if you like my
      work and need to hire a programmer/math guy who's concerned about the current state of the earth, please reach
      out.

      Ah, I see you want more information about me. Well, here it is. Please don't use it nefariously.
      <br><br>
      I am a programmer and math tutor living in Vancouver, BC. I studied at Quest University Canada in Squamish, where
      I received a Bachelor's of Arts and Sciences with a focus in mathematics. At Quest, students center their education
      on a question of their choosing; I asked, "How can I make simple things complicated?"
      <br><br>
      We are surrounded by simple things. Bread seems pretty simple. Lighters are simple. The patterns in linoleum or
      wallpaper are simple. I like to see what kind of complexity can be derived from the simple things. What makes the
      air bubbles in bread? Why does the flame on a lighter initially seem to jump up when lit? How are the patterns of
      wallpaper fundamentally similar or different?
      <br><br>
      I find there's a lot to be learned from exploring the hidden intricacies of things.
      <br><br>
      You can find my additional projects on GitHub at
      <a class="normal-link" href="https://github.com/ahblay">https://github.com/ahblay</a>
      and Kaggle at <a class="normal-link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/ahblay">https://www.kaggle.com/ahblay</a>.
      <br><br>
      Oh, and check out this report on me in the world-famous Sonoma Index Tribune:
      <a class="normal-link" href="https://www.sonomanews.com/news/3387774-181/local-student-studies-in-antarctica">
        https://www.sonomanews.com/news/3387774-181/local-student-studies-in-antarctica
      </a>.
      <br><br>
      And here's the first edition of Momenta, Quest University's academic journal, of which I am a co-founder:
