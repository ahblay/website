<div class="desc">
  Athena made omelettes for breakfast. They were pretty good, but she sure hyped them up a LOT. Like, I was just tring
  to eat mine and she was all like, "Eat it faster because it's a real French omelette and the real French people eat
  their omelettes fast and if you don't it will be garbage but that will be your fault not mine." And I was like, "That
  seems a little unreasonable, Athena. I will try to eat it like a normal person, but not to such an absurd degree of
  excess that I might choke." And she was like, "Fine... But don't blame me when things go awry."

  So, in conclusion, the omelette was pretty good, but the constant nagging while I was attempting to appreciate it's
  purportedly subtle flavours reduced the eating experience to something only a touch above banal.
