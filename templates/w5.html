<div class="desc">
  I feel as though I am most motivated to learn by examining, in depth, questions or topics that may seem, at the
  surface, innocuous or otherwise uninteresting. Questions like "what is speed?", to explore the basic ideas of calculus.
  I figure that I might as well jot down questions like this when they occur to me (or are asked of me). That's what
  this is for.
  <div class="title-sm yellow">Questions</div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Why do rockets work? What is thrust? How do different things move? What are the fundamental types of movement?
      I'd like to understand what the physics of motion really are. Cars move because their tires create
      friction with the road, humans move because their feet create friction with the ground, unless they are jumping,
      in which case something else is happening. I think? Do propellers move things forward because they create a vacuum,
      or because they create thrust? Is motion just the exchange of mass from one place to another? Are these stupid
      questions?
