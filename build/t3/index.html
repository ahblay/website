<div class="desc">
  When you decide to apply to graduate programs for a Master's in Applied Math and you completed your protracted,
  five-year undergrad two years ago, you must quickly come to terms with the fact that most of the theorems and proofs
  you spent so many hours laboring over and (mis)understanding have entirely vanished from your consciousness. Some
  might respond to this realization with an alarmed determination, and throw themselves heartily into such instructive
  and thorough resources as Paul's Online Math notes, or perhaps [Committed Student A]'s Classroom Notes. However,
  as a student who prided himself on his sketchy-at-best note-taking habit, I simply do not have this resource to fall
  back on. But, no fear! I have an inventive shortcut. Why review entire courses when a lovely organization known fondly
  as ETS has provided a list of example problems from all the subjects they consider to be necessary for an aspiring
  graduate student to understand? Surely, a thorough explanation of each problem from the GRE practice booklet will
  be just as instructive. (I pray). So this is that. And that is that. And here we go.

  <div class="title-sm yellow">Problem 1</div>
  <div class="math">\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(3x) - 1}{x^2}</div>
  Right off the bat, we can feel discouraged that this isn't as simple as just setting <span class="math">x = 0</span>
  and simplifying the expression. We're going to have to do some clever substitions to get that <span class="math">x</span>
  out of the denominator. AHA! A cursory Google reveals some useful limits that may help us out.
  <div class="math">
    \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} = 1 \quad\mathrm{and}\quad \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(\theta) - 1}{\theta} = 0
  </div>
  What if we do a little algebra to get our original limit to look a little bit more like one of these?
  <div class="math">\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(3x) - 1}{3x} \times \frac{3}{x}</div>
  NOPE! SHIT. This isn't right. We forgot that this limit is <i>indeterminate</i>. And when limits are
  <i>indeterminate</i>, we gotta apply L'Hospital's Rule. Google quickly summarizes L'Hospital's Rule as follows:
  <div class="math">\text{If}\quad \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{0}{0} \quad\text{then}\quad \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}</div>
  So now we must go about differentiating <span class="math">\cos(3x) - 1</span> and <span class="math">x^2</span>.
  Recalling that the derivative of <span class="math">\cos(x)</span> is <span class="math">-\sin(x)</span> and
  remembering to implement the product rule, this leaves us with
  <div class="math">\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{-3\sin(3x)}{2x}.</div>
  Let's <i>now</i> try to get this looking a bit more like expression (2). With some clever algebra, we are left with:
  <div class="math">\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(3x)}{3x} \times \frac{-9}{2}.</div>
  The first fraction simplifies to 1, and so we are left with the answer <span class="math">\boxed{\frac{-9}{2}.}</span>

  <div class="title-sm yellow">Problem 2</div>
  What is the area of an equilateral triangle whose inscribed circle has radius 2?
  <br><br>
  This question feels like it could be solved with ease if one knew (or could recall) more facts about inscribed circles
  and equilateral triangles. Still, it's readily solvable without helpful facts, so let's do it that way. We'll begin by
  creating a right triangle with angles 30˚, 60˚ and 90˚ and sides 2, x and y. It happens that 6 of these such triangles
  will form our original equilateral triangle. (This isn't just random good fortune, obviously. Also, I understand a
  diagram would be helpful, but it's too much work to figure out how to do that in KaTeX (not a typo; it's the package
  I'm using to render LaTeX in the browser), so you can draw one if you want.) As such, we simply need to find the area
  of this triangle, multiply it by 6, and we have our answer. We recall from high school (and Google) that 30-60-90
  triangles have sides 1, 2 and <span class="math">\sqrt{3}.</span> In our case, this leaves us with sides 2, 4 and
  <span class="math">2\sqrt{3}</span>. The area of this triangle is then:
  <div class="math">\frac{1}{2} \times 2\sqrt{3} \times {2} = 2\sqrt{3}.</div>
  Multiplying this result by 6 gives us the area of the original equilateral triangle:
  <span class="math">\boxed{12\sqrt{3}}.</span>

  <div class="title-sm yellow">Problem 3</div>
  <div class="math">\int_{e^{-3}}^{e^{-2}} \frac{1}{x \log x} \, dx</div>
  Oof. This one is a real doozy. Let's try to break it down into quasi-digestible pieces. We'll begin by finding the
  definite integral. Once that's done, we can worry about evaluating the result. (Whether or not this is a prudent
  or practical choice is very much an open question, but let's hope that at worst it is instructive.) Okay.
  <br><br>
  Recall that certain integrals can be solved using substitution. Specifically, the substitution technique works when
  the integral to be evaluated takes the form <span class="math">\int f(g(x)) \, g'(x) \, dx</span>, and is summarized as
  follows:
  <div class="math">\int f(g(x))\, g'(x) \, dx = \int f(u) \, du \quad\text{where}\quad u = g(x).</div>
  In our case, <span class="math">g(x) = \log(x)</span> and <span class="math">g'(x) = \frac{1}{x}.</span> (This
  second fact may seem surprising if you've largely forgotten all of integral calculus, as I have. Don't stress it.
  StackOverflow tells me it's true.) Proceeding with the substitution, we have <span class="math">u = \log(x)</span>
  and <span class="math">du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx</span>. Then:
  <div class="math">\int \frac{1}{x \log x} \, dx = \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \quad\text{where}\quad u = \log(x).</div>
  Integrating the right-hand side and substituting back in for u, we are left with the expression:
  <div class="math">\log(\log(x)).</div>
  Now, we must evaluate this result at <span class="math">e^{-2}</span> and <span class="math">e^{-3}.</span> Doing so,
  we have:
  <div class="math">\log(\log(e^{-2})) - \log(\log(e^{-3})).</div>
  Recalling (through the aid of Google) the properties of logarithms, we can make a series of simplifications:
  <div class="math">
    \begin{aligned}
      \log(-2)) - \log(-3)) \\
      \log\left(\frac{-2}{-3}\right) \\
      \log\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)
    \end{aligned}
  </div>
  This gives us the final result: <span class="math">\boxed{\log\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}</span>.

  <div class="title-sm yellow">Problem 4</div>
  Let <span class="math">V</span> and <span class="math">W</span> be 4-dimensional subspaces of a 7-dimensional vector
  space <span class="math">X</span>. Which of the following CANNOT be the dimension of the subspace
  <span class="math">V \cap W</span>?
  <br><br>
  We're at a real risk of exposing how very little I actually know about linear algebra here. However (and fortunately),
  this problem is actually rather simple with the appropriate tools. We need the following two facts about vector spaces
  and subspaces:
  <div class="math">\dim(V + W) = \dim(V) + \dim(W) - \dim(V \cap W)</div>
  and
  <div class="math">\dim(V + W) \leq \dim(X).</div>
  We know that <span class="math">\dim(X) = 7</span>, so <span class="math">\dim(V + W) \leq 7</span>. Substituting this
  result into equation (14), we have:
  <div class="math">7 \geq \dim(V) + \dim(W) - \dim(V \cap W).</div>
  Finally, plugging in values and solving for <span class="math">V \cap W</span>:
  <div class="math">
    \begin{aligned}
      7 &\geq 4 + 4 - \dim(V \cap W) \\
      -1 &\geq - \dim(V \cap W) \\
      1 &\leq \dim(V \cap W).
    \end{aligned}
  </div>
  We are left with the fact that the subspace <span class="math">V \cap W</span> must be greater than 0.

  <div class="title-sm yellow">Problem 5</div>
  Sofia and Tess will each randomly choose one of the 10 integers from 1 to 10. What is the probability that neither
  integer chosen will be the square of the other?
  <br><br>
  Ah, combinatorics. This should be okay. Let's find the probability that one integer <i>will</i> be the square of the
  other; then we can simply subtract that result from 1. First, how many possible choices are there? Both Sofia and Tess
  have 10 integers to select from, so that leaves us with a total of <span class="math">10 \times 10 = 100</span>
  combinations. The only numbers that are perfect squares are 1, 4 and 9. These can be selected in 5 unqiue ways:
  <div class="math">(1, 1), \,\, (2, 4), \,\, (4, 2), \,\, (3, 9), \quad\text{and}\quad (9, 3).</div>
  Therefore, there is a <span class="math">\frac{5}{100}</span> probability that one integer <i>will</i> be the square
  of the other. This means that there is a <span class="math">1 - 0.05 = 0.95</span> probability that <i>neither</i>
  integer is the square of the other.

  <div class="title-sm yellow">Problem 6</div>
  Which of the following shows the numbers <span class="math">2^\frac{1}{2}</span>,
  <span class="math">3^\frac{1}{3}</span>, and <span class="math">6^\frac{1}{6}</span>in increasing order?
  <br><br>
  The trick here is to find a common exponent for these three numbers. <span class="math">2^\frac{1}{2}</span> can be
  re-written as <span class="math">2^\frac{3}{6} = 8^\frac{1}{6}</span>. Similarly,
  <span class="math">3^\frac{1}{3} = 3^\frac{2}{6} = 9^\frac{1}{6}.</span> Now, we can clearly see the order to be
  <span class="math">\boxed{6^\frac{1}{6} \leq 2^\frac{1}{2} \leq 3^\frac{1}{3}}.</span>

  <div class="title-sm yellow">Problem 7</div>
  <img id="gre-curve" class="plot" src="../static/gre_curve.png">
  The figure above shows the graph of the derivative <span class="math">f'</span> of a function
  <span class="math">f</span>, where <span class="math">f</span> is continuous on the interval
  <span class="math">[0, 4]</span> and differentiable on the interval <span class="math">(0, 4)</span>. What is the
  proper ordering of the values <span class="math">f(0)</span>, <span class="math">f(2)</span> and
  <span class="math">f(4)</span>?
  <br><br>
  This shouldn't be too tricky. (To editorialize, the truly tricky part of this problem was rendering a passable
  depiction of the graph from the GRE practice booklet. Fortunately, it was relatively easy to identify the graph as a
  piecewise function consisting of an ellipse and a circle. You'll be satisfied to hear that the above reproduction is
  precisely identical to the original.) Let's consider the general behavior of <span class="math">f</span>. From
  <span class="math">f'</span>, we can see that <span class="math">f</span> begins sloping upwards, gradually flattens
  out, briefly slopes down, and then flattens out again. At <span class="math">f(0)</span>, this slope is positive, at
  <span class="math">f(2)</span> it is zero, and at <span class="math">f(4)</span> it is also zero.
