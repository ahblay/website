  Let's suppose that as a child, you had two goldfish that you kept in a tank on your kitchen counter. When you first
  bought them, they were rather small, and could comfortably swim around in such a confined habitat. However, as the
  years passed, these goldfish grew larger and larger, until they could no longer exist comfortably in the increasingly
  stifling tank. At this point, your mother suggested that you move them from the kitchen to the small pond in your
  backyard. With some sadness, you complied, and much to your delight, the two original fish laid eggs and the
  previously bereft pond bloomed into a goldfish utopia.
  <br><br>
  Many years later, in an entirely normal and certainly not contrived flash of curiosity, you decide that you wish to
  understand exactly what caused your goldfish population to grow as they did. Fortunately, you were a creepy little
  science nerd, and every time a new generation of fish was born into that scummy pond, you counted them all up and
  wrote the total in your journal. Looking back at this data, you see the following:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="yellow">Generation</th>
      <th class="yellow">Population size</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
