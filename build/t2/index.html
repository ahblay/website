  Let's suppose that as a child, you had two goldfish that you kept in a tank on your kitchen counter. When you first
  bought them, they were rather small, and could comfortably swim around in such a confined habitat. However, as the
  years passed, these goldfish grew larger and larger, until they could no longer exist comfortably in the increasingly
  stifling tank. At this point, your mother suggested that you move them from the kitchen to the small pond in your
  backyard. With some sadness, you complied, and much to your delight, the two original fish laid eggs and the
  previously bereft pond bloomed into a goldfish utopia.
  <br><br>
  Many years later, in an entirely normal and certainly not contrived flash of curiosity, you decide that you wish to
  understand exactly what caused your goldfish population to grow as they did. Fortunately, you were a creepy little
  science nerd, and every time a new generation of fish was born into that scummy pond, you counted them all up and
  wrote the total in your journal. Looking back at this data, you see the following:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="yellow">Generation</th>
      <th class="yellow">Population size</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>11</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>19</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>20</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  You notice that although the population growth starts off rather vigorously, after the fifth generation, the goldfish
  seem to have settled their numbers at around twenty. In fact, checking the pond today, there seem to be roughly the
  same number of fish as there were back when you stopped keeping track in your journal. To assure yourself of this
  conclusion, you sketch out a quick graph of the pond's goldfish population by generation:
  <img id="simple-fish" class="plot" src="../static/simple_fish.png">
  It certainly seems that your assessment was correct! At first, the population grows rapidly, but then it seems to hit
  a wall at which it cannot increase further. 'Neat, I guess,' you think, and then go off to browse reddit because,
  honestly, who cares about the growth of a goldfish population in a pond?
  <br><br>
  Okay, so that's enough with the stupid storytelling. What I was trying to do in the paragraphs above was illustrate an
  important (and perhaps obvious) fact about modelling population dynamics in nature (or ponds): growth is NOT
  rampantly exponential. It's pretty easy to understand why this is true. The world that we live in has a finite supply
  of resources. Whether we are talking about the global human population or goldfish in a backyard pond, there's only
  so much food and space to share before we (or the fish) become starved and stifled. Of course, before we reach this
  resource ceiling (so to speak), there's very little to stop a population from booming--providing the hopeful
  assumption that no big predators are out there eating many of us. This is why the goldfish seemed to be doing so well
  for the first five generations, before their numbers tapered off at twenty.
  <div class="title-sm yellow">The S-curve</div>
  It seems that many examples of population growth follow a shape similar to that of our goldfish population. (Does it
  not seem that way? Check out these:
  <a class="normal-link" href="http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york-city-population/">New York City</a>
  and <a class="normal-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization#city-populations">many others</a>.) The
  next question (this being a math post, after all) is how we might use an equation to model the shape of these curves.
  What type of equation would both express the initial quasi-exponential growth of a population and the subsequent
  tapering off as that population reached carrying capacity?
  <br><br>
  Let's first attempt to describe the exponential growth phase. Certainly, a population's growth is a function of its
  size. Let's consider how large a population of size <span class="math">P_t</span> will become after one generation.
  At the very least, the subsequent generation (which we shall call <span class="math">P_{t+1}</span>) will be equal to
  <span class="math">P_t</span>. So, in the most basic case, we have:
  <div class="math">P_{t+1} = P_t.</div>
  We should also like to add some term that accounts for new offspring born into the population. As we discussed before,
  the number of offspring ought to be a function of the current population's size. Let's suppose that some percentage
  <span class="math">r</span> of the current population breed each generation. In that case, the number of new
  offspring can be represented by <span class="math">rP_t</span>. Putting all of this together, we can come up with
  an equation to describe the exponential growth phase after one generation:
  <div class="math">P_{t+1} = P_t + rP_t.</div>
  The issue here is that this equation will produce larger and larger outputs generation after generation. There
  is nothing to slow it down. What can we do to fix this?
  <br><br>
  Let's begin by supposing that the population will tail off at some known value <span class="math">M</span>. We shall
  refer to this value as the "carrying capacity." We want to find some way to curb the population growth as it trends
  nearer to <span class="math">M</span>. In other words, we want to do something to the exponential growth term
  <span class="math">rP_t</span> that causes it to decrease as <span class="math">P_t</span> approaches
  <span class="math">M</span>. One such approach would be to multiply <span class="math">rP_t</span> by some expression
  that gets smaller and smaller as the value of <span class="math">P_t</span> nears that of <span class="math">M</span>.
  Here's what that expression might look like:
  <div class="math">1 - \frac{P_t}{M}.</div>
  We can see that as <span class="math">P_t</span> becomes larger, the ratio <span class="math">\frac{P_t}{M}</span>
  approaches 1, and the overall expression approaches 0. Furthermore, if the current population is larger than the
  carrying capacity, the ratio will be greater than 1, and the expression becomes negative. This means that if our population
  is overcrowded, our model will account for this fact and cause the population size to diminish. Let's put all of these
  ideas together:
  <div class="math">P_{t+1} = P_t + rP_t \left( 1 - \frac{P_t}{M} \right).</div>
  Does this equation achieve our goal of modelling an S-curve? Let's suppose that the carrying capacity is
  <span class="math">M=20</span>, that <span class="math">30\%</span> of our population breeds each generation
  (<span class="math">r=0.5</span>), and that we start with a population of size 2. This gives:
  <div class="math">P_{t+1} = P_t + 0.3P_t \left( 1 - \frac{P_t}{20} \right), \; P_0=2.</div>
  What are the dynamics of our population? Does our model work?
  <img id="log-map-example" class="plot" src="../static/log_map_example.png">
  It certainly seems to! The plot above exhibits the behavior that we are looking for. Our population initially grows at
  a relatively slow rate, speeds up as it gains more individuals, and then tapers off as it approaches carrying capacity.
  This essentially checks all of our boxes.
  <br><br>
  Let's see if we can clean up our model without adversely affecting its behavior. In particular, instead of calculating the
  population size <span class="math">P_t</span>, let us simply determine the population as some percentage of the carrying
  capacity, which we shall refer to as <span class="math">x_t</span>. In other words, let
  <div class="math">x_t = \frac{P_t}{M}.</div>
  Solving for <span class="math">P_t</span> and plugging the resulting expression in equation (4) gives:
  <div class="math">x_{t+1} = x_t + rx_t(1-x_t).</div>
  This has the effect of normalizing the population size. (That is to say, it squishes the population down to a range of
  values between 0 and 1.) The resulting plot is shown below:
  <img id="log-map-example-2" class="plot" src="../static/log_map_example_2.png">
  Okay, sweet. We've managed to develop in equation (7) a reasonably good model for goldfish populations in ponds.
  What can we actually do with it?
  <div class="title-sm yellow">Some Analysis</div>
  One natural question we might ask is, "What is the rate of growth of our population at some time
  <span class="math">t</span>?" To situate this in a somewhat more believable context, imagine that we've developed a
  model for the population of New York City (this is assuming that the population dynamics of huge metropolitan areas
  directly parallel that of fish in a pond, which is dubious at best), and we wish to predict the rate of growth in the
  year 2050. It would be convenient to have an equation that allows us to do this. What might this equation look like?
  <br><br>
  Since equation (7) provides population as a percentage of carrying capacity <span class="math">x_t</span> at discrete
  time-steps <span class="math">t</span>, the best growth rate we can hope for is given by the change in population between
  time-steps <span class="math">t</span> and <span class="math">t+1</span>. Graphically, this amounts to determining the slope
  of the line between <span class="math">t</span> and <span class="math">t+1</span>. Using point-slope form, this is given by:
  <div class="math">\frac{x_{t+1} - x_t}{t+1 - t} = x_{t+1} - x_t.</div>
  Note that rearranging equation (7) gives <span class="math">x_{t+1} - x_t = rx_t(1-x_t)</span>. Therefore, we have the
  following equation for the growth rate of the population between time-steps <span class="math">t</span> and
  <span class="math">t+1</span>:
  <div class="math">\frac{x_{t+1} - x_t}{t+1 - t} = rx_t(1-x_t).</div>
  Describing this in (admittedly verbose) English, we might say that "the rate of change of the population between
  time-steps <span class="math">t</span> and <span class="math">t+1</span> is a function of the size of the population
  at time <span class="math">t</span>." If you are familiar with the language of calculus, this may sound suspiciously
  similar to the definition of the derivative.
  <div class="title-sm yellow">From Discrete to Continuous</div>
  At this point, it is helpful to make a small shift in notation. Until now, we have used the variable
  <span class="math">x_t</span> to refer to the population size at time <span class="math">t</span>. This is because our
  function for population was defined recursively, and it is conventional for recursive functions to use subscripts.
  However, it is equivalently correct to use function notation for the population size. Making this notational edit to
  equation (9), we obtain:
  <div class="math">\frac{x(t+1) - x(t)}{t+1 - t} = rx(t)(1-x(t)).</div>
  Recall that the function <span class="math">x(t)</span> is still the same recursive function described in equation (7).
  In particular:
  <div class="math">x(t) = x(t-1) + rx(t-1)(1-x(t-1)).</div>
  So far, nothing has changed apart from notation.
  <br><br>
  However, it is worth asking what might happen if <span class="math">x(t)</span> were some other function. Specifically,
  what if <span class="math">x(t)</span> were continuous for all inputs <span class="math">t</span>, rather than recursively
  defined for discrete time-steps? What would such a function look like? Ideally, it would model the same S-curve behavior
  as our recursive function, but simply smoothed out for all possible times <span class="math">t</span>.
  <br><br>
  Let's suppose that <span class="math">x(t)</span> is continuous, and see what happens. Since <span class="math">x(t)</span>
  is continuous, it now makes sense to determine the growth rate over an interval of less than one time-step. Let's
  re-write equation (10) to describe the growth rate over the interval between <span class="math">t</span> and
  <span class="math">t+ \Delta t</span>:
  <div class="math">\frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t} = rx(t)(1-x(t)).</div>
  In fact, there's really no reason to limit ourselves to an interval. It would be even better to simply determine the
  instantaneous growth rate at time <span class="math">t</span>. We can obtain this by taking the limit as
  <span class="math">\Delta t</span> approaches zero:
  <div class="math">\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t} = rx(t)(1-x(t)).</div>
  Recall that the right-hand side of the above equation is precisely the derivative of <span class="math">x(t)</span>,
  which we may write as <span class="math">x'(t)</span> (see
  <a class="normal-link" href="https://www.abelromer.com/t1">the thing I wrote about calculus</a>). Therefore, we have:
  <div class="math">x'(t) = rx(t)(1-x(t)).</div>
  What does this mean? It says that the continuous version of our recursive population function (equation (7)) is the
  function <span class="math">x(t)</span> whose derivative is equal to <span class="math">rx(t)(1-x(t))</span>. How to we
  figure out what this function is?
