<div class="desc">
  I suspect that calculus is much easier to understand than we are led to believe. The real question is whether
  I can support this claim by teaching it in a comprehensible way. I'm gonna give it a go here. Hopefully you'll find
  it more educational and less daunting.
  <br><br>
  Before I begin, I'd like to lay out what I understand to be the roadmap for a typical undergraduate Calc 1 course. I
  see it as three basic steps:
  <ol>
    <li>Intuition and justification</li>
    <li>Mathematical explanation for intuition</li>
    <li>Lots of rules</li>
  </ol>
  For the most part, I will skip step 3. Once you understand the mechanism for how calculus works (step 2), the rules
  begin to fall into place. I'd like to spend much more time on the first two steps. Let's do it.
  <div class="title-sm yellow">What is Speed?</div>
  The traditional method for explaining/justifying the need for calculus is to use the example of a car. Imagine you're
  a drag racer. (If this is too thrilling, or you're particularly unimaginative, you can think of driving on the
  freeway.) You're idling behind the starting line (or whatever the proper terms are for drag races--it's not within the
  scope of this discussion) as the light blinks from red, to yellow, to green (see previous parenthetical). As it turns
  green, you kick the car into gear and go roaring off down the track.
  <br><br>
  Let's suppose that 5 seconds after the race has begun, you glance down at the speedometer (do drag racers do this?)
  and see that it reads 70 MPH. What does this mean? Well, quite literally it says that you are going seventy miles
  every hour. Of course, the racetrack is nowhere near seventy miles long, so this number is really just an average. It's
  telling you that, if you kept going at exactly the speed you are going right now for one hour, you would cover exactly
  seventy miles.
  <br><br>
  Okay. This seems mostly fine. There's just one little question. What does "the speed you are going right now" really
  mean? This isn't meant to be a stupid question. Think about it. How long is "right now?" It's not one second. That
  would include a little bit of time before "right now". It isn't one tenth of a second. There's still a pesky little
  bit of "back then" time. Clearly, it isn't any range of time, no matter how small. It's just one, very specific point
  in time. It's as though we took a picture of the car. But if we just look at that picture of a car, it certainly isn't
  moving. (You might object and suggest that the photo of the car really isn't one point in time, because the camera's
  shutter takes some period of time to close, and so the picture really does capture movement--the car may appear
  blurry--but let's take some liberties and ignore this issue.) So is "the speed you are going right now" zero? That
  doesn't feel quite right.
  <br><br>
  Let's revisit what speed is. In the States, we typically think of speed as miles per hour. The civilized world measures
  it in kilometers per hour. The scientific community says meters per second. No matter what you choose, you are stuck
  with some form of distance per time. And each of these is fundamentally an average. And we want to know what happens
  when that time component drops down to "right now." In other words, we want to know what speed means when the time
  elapsed is zero. And not only that. We decided that that in the "right now" moment, the car isn't moving either. So,
  after all that, we want to know what speed means when no movement has taken place and no time has passed. We want
  <div class="math">\frac{0 m}{0 s}.</div>
  Clearly, this number is going to vary a lot depending on context. If we take a picture of a moving car, its speed at
  this instantaneous moment in time ought to be very different from that of a parked car. Let's think of some of the ways
  we might provide this context.
  <br><br>
  One approach might be to take two successive pictures of the car. Let's suppose we take one picture five seconds after
  it has left the starting line, and a second two seconds later. Furthermore, let's make note of how far the car has
  travelled when each photo is taken. This should help us establish some context for how quickly the car's position is
  changing relative to time. And how quickly is its position changing? It's just the amount of distance covered divided
  by the amount of time elapsed between those two photos. For example, let's say that the car had covered 200 meters
  when the first photo was taken, and 300 meters when the second photo was taken. Then:
  <div class="math">\frac{300m - 200m}{7s - 5s} = 50 \space m/s</div>
  What does this result tell us? It's saying that in the time between when the two photos were taken, the car's position
  changed an average of 50 meters every second, or its average speed was 50 meters per second. It seems that providing
  context to our one photo of the car has allowed us estimate its speed. This is useful, but it still doesn't tell us
  the speed is it going "right now." We're still stuck guessing between "then" and "now." However, sometimes guesswork
  can be insightful, so let's try to refine this estimate.
  <br><br>
  It seems that the closer in time that we take our photos, the more precise our approximations will become. With that
  in mind, let's try taking our second photo just one second after the first. Now, the car has travelled 240 meters,
  and so we find its average speed to be
  <div class="math">\frac{240m - 200m}{6s - 5s} = 40 \space m/s.</div>
  Continuing this process, we might measure the car's progress after half a second, or a quarter second, or and eighth...
  In fact, we would hope to get our two measurements as close as possible, while ensuring that they still differ by
  some minute quantity (so as to avoid the dividing by zero complexity we encountered in equation (1)). Mathematicians,
  being lazy creatures, have developed some symbols to summarize this process, and we shall introduce some of them here.
  <br><br>
  Let's begin with our variables for distance and time, which we shall represent with <span class="math">s</span> and
  <span class="math">t</span>, respectively. (We use <span class="math">s</span> rather than <span class="math">d</span>
  because <span class="math">d</span> will be used to mean something else entirely, and we don't wish to confuse
  ourselves.) Rather calculating the difference between two distances and times, we shall represent these differences
  with the expressions <span class="math">\Delta s</span> and <span class="math">\Delta t</span>. (The symbol
  <span class="math">\Delta</span> is pronounced "delta" and can be thought to mean "change in.") Finally, to
  communicate the idea that our two photos are taken nearer and nearer to each other, we shall say that we are looking
  for "the limit as the change in time approaches zero," and symbolize this as
  <span class="math">\lim_{\Delta t \to 0}</span>. Putting all of this together, we may summarize our process for
  guessing the car's instantaneous speed as
  <div class="math">\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}.</div>
  Great. So what actually is the car's instantaneous speed?
  <br><br>
  In order to answer that question, let's take a step back and more accurately define the motion of the car. We'll be
  super precise and describe exactly how far it has travelled at every moment since leaving the starting line. For
  simplicity's sake, let's assume that the car accelerates all the way to the finish line. (While this may not be
  strictly true for drag racers, it will make the math simpler, so we'll let it slide.) Let's define the car's distance
  travelled <span class="math">s</span> as
  <div class="math">s = 8t^2.</div>
  While this equation isn't strictly accurate (we shall see that at the end of the race the car is going over 250 MPH),
  it is good enough to illustrate the point. The equation is graphed below.
  <img id="simple-car" class="plot" src="../static/simple_car.png">
  Let's note when we took photos of the car as two red points on this line: one at 5 seconds and the other at 7.
  <img id="photos-car" class="plot" src="../static/photos_car.png">
  Recall that to find the average speed between when these photos were taken, we used the equation
  <div class="math">\frac{s_1 - s_2}{t_1 - t_2}</div>
  where <span class="math">s_n</span> is the distance travelled when the n-th photo was taken and
  <span class="math">t_n</span> is the time when the n-th photo was taken. For those of us who remember a bit of high
  school algebra, equation (6) might be familiar as the expression for the slope of a line passing through the points
  <span class="math">(t_1, s_1)</span> and <span class="math">(t_2, s_2)</span>. What we are saying is that the
  average speed of the car between two points in time can be represented as the slope of a line drawn between those two
  points.
  <img id="slope-car" class="plot" src="../static/slope_car.png">
  Just as before, we would like to know what happens when we move these two points closer and closer together. (Recall
  that the nearer these points are, the better an approximation we have for the car's speed.) Let's do just that,
  drawing each of the slopes (representing the speeds) onto our plot.
  <img id="multislope-car" class="plot" src="../static/multislope_car.png">
  Although it is a little difficult to read, we can see that the nearer our points get, the better their slope approximates
  the shape of the curve itself. This is increasingly obvious if we zoom in on the two nearest points, where we see the
  slopes as nearly identical:
  <img id="multislope-car-zoom" class="plot" src="../static/multislope_car_zoom.png">
  When, then, is the geometrical interpretation of "the speed right now?" It is the slope of the line that we get when
  those two points converge. In other words, it is the slope of the line that intersects the curve at exactly one point.
  Such a line is said to be tangent to the curve (or a tangent line) and every point on a continuous, smooth curve has
  exactly one of these. So, the natural question becomes: "How can we find the slope of this tangent line at a given
  point?" If we find this, we have found our instantaneous speed.
  <div class="title-sm yellow">Finding the Slope of a Tangent Line</div>
  Let's revisit expression (4):
  <div class="math">\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}.</div>
  Remember that this means, "the limit as the change in time approaches zero of the change in distance divided by the
  change in time," or, "the limit as the change in time approaches zero of the average velocity." How might we apply
  this idea to our expression for the car's movement:
  <div class="math">s = 8t^2?</div>
  Before, when estimating the velocity, we chose two specific points in time to get an average. Let's do the same thing,
  but instead of picking numerical values (like 5 seconds and 7 seconds), we'll pick arbitrary points in time. We shall
  call the point in time for which we wish to measure the instantaneous speed <span class="math">t_0</span>, and the
  other point <span class="math">t_0 + \Delta t</span>. In this way, we may calculate the average speed over the
  interval <span class="math">\Delta t</span>, for a <span class="math">\Delta t</span> of arbitrarily small size. Let's
  apply this idea to expression (4).
  <br><br>
  What is <span class="math">\Delta s</span> in this expression? Recall that <span class="math">\Delta s</span>
  describes the difference in distance between our two points in time. But what is the expression for this distance?
  It's right there in equation (8)! We simply need to evaluate this equation at the points
  <span class="math">t_0</span> and <span class="math">t_0 + \Delta t</span>. Doing so, we find that
  <div class="math">\Delta s = 8(t_0 + \Delta t)^2 - 8 t_0^2.</div>
  Expanding and combining like terms in this expression leaves us with
  <div class="math">\Delta s = 16 t_0 \Delta t + (\Delta t)^2.</div>
  Let's plug this result back into expression (4). (The denominator of expression (4) remains the same. In our case, we
  have <span class="math">\Delta t = (t_0 + \Delta t) - t_0 = \Delta t.</span>) Doing so gives us
  <div class="math">\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{16 t_0 \Delta t + (\Delta t)^2}{\Delta t}.</div>
  Let's cancel the <span class="math">\Delta t</span>'s:
  <div class="math">\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} 16 t_0 + \Delta t.</div>
  Now, before we do the crucial last step, let's review what it is we are looking at. The expression
  <span class="math">16 t_0 + \Delta t</span> gives us the average velocity of the car between the points in time
  <span class="math">t_0</span> and <span class="math">t_0 + \Delta t.</span> We take "the limit as
  <span class="math">t</span> approaches zero" of this expression to determine increasing accurate estimations of the
  instantaneous velocity of the car at time <span class="math">t_0</span>. Okay.
  <br><br>
  Let's let <span class="math">t_0</span> go towards zero. Unlike before, this is achievable due to the fact that we no
  longer have any <span class="math">\Delta t</span>'s in the denominator. Setting <span class="math">\Delta t</span>
  to zero, we get
  <div class="math">16 t_0.</div>
  This is an expression for the instantaneous velocity at time <span class="math">t_0</span>! This result allows us to
  determine the exact speed at which the car is moving at any point in time. It also tells us the slope of the line
  tangent to the curve <span class="math">s = 8 t^2</span> at any point <span class="math">t_0</span>. Let's now take a
  moment to discuss how we might have achieved this result geometrically.
  <br><br>
  As before, we shall start with a graph of this curve, and consider two points on this graph:
  <span class="math">t_0</span> and <span class="math">t_0 + \Delta t</span>.
  <img id="deltas-car" class="plot" src="../static/deltas_car.png">
  We then wish to take the limit as
  <span class="math">\Delta t</span> approaches zero. Similarly to our previous discussion, we can achieve this by
  moving the point <span class="math">t_0 + \Delta t</span> nearer and nearer to <span class="math">t_0</span>. When
  these points converge, the line that was formed by connecting them becomes the tangent line, and it's slope becomes
  <span class="math">\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} 16 t_0 + \Delta t</span>, or <span class="math">16 t_0</span>.
  <div class="title-sm yellow">Going Further</div>
  In the previous section, we laid out a method for finding the instantaneous speed of a car given an equation modelling
  its movement. Let's quickly review this method, and show how it might be used on any arbitrary equation.
  <br><br>
  We began with a function describing the car's position <span class="math">s</span> at any time
  <span class="math">t</span>. Rather than giving a specific equation, let's just call this function
  <span class="math">f(t)</span>. We then chose two values (points in time) at which to evaluate this function. We
  called these values <span class="math">t_0</span> and <span class="math"> t_0 + \Delta t</span>. Plugging these values
  into our function gives us <span class="math">f(t_0)</span> and <span class="math">f(t_0 + \Delta t</span>. We then
  calculated the average speed between these two points using the expression
  <div class="math">\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}. </div>
  Doing this here, we are left with
  <div class="math">\frac{f(t_0 + \Delta t) - f(t_0)}{\Delta t}.</div>
  Finally, we took the limit as <span class="math">\Delta t</span> approached zero. In our case:
  <div class="math">\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{f(t_0 + \Delta t) - f(t_0)}{\Delta t}.</div>
  Let's do a quick example to show how this process might work on a different equation. We'll try
  <div class="math">f(t) = 3 t^3 + 2t + 5.</div>
  First, we calculate <span class="math">f(t_0)</span> and <span class="math">f(t_0 + \Delta t)</span>. We find:
  <div class="math">f(t_0) = 3 t_0^3 + 2t_0 + 5</div>
  <div class="math">f(t_0 + \Delta t) = 3 (t_0 + \Delta t)^3 + 2(t_0 + \Delta t) + 5.</div>
  Let's first simplify the second equation. We'll begin by multiplying out the exponents:
  <div class="math">f(t_0 + \Delta t) = 3 (t_0^3 + 3 t_0^2 \Delta t + 3 t_0 (\Delta t)^2 + (\Delta t)^3) + 2t_0 + 2 \Delta t + 5.</div>
  Tidying and rearranging:
  <div class="math">f(t_0 + \Delta t) = 3 t_0^3 + 2t_0 + 9 t_0^2 \Delta t + 9 t_0 (\Delta t)^2 + 3(\Delta t)^3) + 2 \Delta t + 5.</div>
  Let's plug this into equation (15).
  <div class="math">\frac{(3 t_0^3 + 2t_0 + 9 t_0^2 \Delta t + 9 t_0 (\Delta t)^2 + 3(\Delta t)^3) + 2 \Delta t + 5) -
    (3 t_0^3 + 2t_0 + 5)}{\Delta t}.</div>
  Combining like terms in the numerator and cancelling the <span class="math">\Delta t</span>'s:
  <div class="math">9 t_0^2 + 9 t_0 \Delta t + 3 (\Delta t)^2 + 2.</div>
  We are now prepared to take the limit as <span class="math">\Delta t</span> approaches zero. Doing so, we find that
  <div class="math">\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} 9 t_0^2 + 9 t_0 \Delta t + 3 (\Delta t)^2 + 2 = 9 t_0^2 + 2.</div>
  This, then, is the expression for the instantaneous velocity at time <span class="math">t_0</span> of the object who's
  position is described by the function <span class="math">f(t) = 3 t^3 + 2t + 5</span>. However, given that this function need
  not always describe movement (and in fact could represent a host of other things), it is better to think of this expression
  as the slope of the tangent line at the point <span class="math">t_0</span>.
  <br><br>
  (I should interject here to note that it is also common to refer to this result as the instantaneous rate of change of
  <span class="math">f(t)</span> with respect to <span class="math">t</span>. This makes sense if we consider velocity
  to be the rate of change of distance with respect to time--in other words, "How much distance do we cover over some
  period of time <span class="math">t</span>?" We are simply generalizing this idea away from the concepts of distance
  and time. Also, the instantaneous rate of change of some function <span class="math">f(x)</span> with respect to
  <span class="math">x</span> is more commonly called the derivative of <span class="math">f(x)</span> with respect
  to <span class="math">x</span>.)
  <br><br>
  So, we've found that the derivative of <span class="math">f(t) = 3 t^3 + 2t + 5</span> is
  <span class="math">9 t_0^2 + 2</span>. Unfortunately, the process of attaining this result required some arduous
  algebraic manipulation, and we sure would like to avoid doing that process in the future. Perhaps we can find some
  sort of pattern between a function and its derivative that would allow us to skip the boring math. If we did enough
  examples like the one above, we might notice that every term in the derivative can be found by taking the
  corresponding term in the original function, multiplying its coefficient by the value of its exponent, and reducing
  the exponent's value by one. In mathematical terms, we would say that the derivative of <span class="math">ax^n</span>
  is <span class="math">nax^{n-1}</span>. Let's apply this rule to our example function
  <span class="math">f(t) = 3 t^3 + 2t + 5</span>. We'll look at each term individually:
  <div class="math">3 t^3 \to 9 t^2</div>
  <div class="math">2t = 2t^1 \to 2t^0 = 2</div>
  <div class="math">5 = 5t^0 \to 0 \times 5t^{-1} = 0.</div>
  Summing these back up, we find that the derivative is <span class="math">9t^2 + 2</span>, just as we expected.
  <br><br>
  Some of you may object to the hand-waviness of our approach in the previous paragraph. How are we to know that this
  technique works in all circumstances? We've only seen two examples. What if we have different types of functions?
  This is a very reasonable objection. As it turns out, different functions behave very differently when we try to
  find their derivatives, and the above strategy only works for a very particular subset of them. Learning how to find
  the derivatives of other types of functions is one of the main focuses of an introductory calculus course, and not
  something I'm going to get into here. However, I will present the proof for the above technique (called the Power
  Rule). If you are inspired, the framework for this proof can be adapted to demonstrate how to find the derivatives of
  other types of functions.
  <div class="title-sm yellow">One Little Proof</div>
  We are going to prove the Power Rule. To be perfectly clear, the Power Rule states that the derivative of any
  function <span class="math">f(x)</span> of the form <span class="math">ax^n</span> where <span class="math">a</span>
  is a constant and <span class="math">n</span> is a positive integer is <span class="math">f'(x) = nax^{n-1}</span>.
  (Two things of note here: (1) The Power Rule applies to all real values of <span class="math">n</span>, but this proof
  only works when <span class="math">n</span> is a positive integer, and (2) the derivative of <span class="math">f(x)</span>
  is typically written in one of two ways--<span class="math">f'(x)</span> or <span class="math">\frac{d}{dx} f(x)</span>.)
  <br><br>
  We shall approach this proof in much the same way that we went about finding the derivatives of specific functions:
  <ol>
    <li>Calculate the value of our function <span class="math">f(x) = ax^n</span> at two specific points
      <span class="math">b</span> and <span class="math">c</span>.</li>
    <li>Determine the average rate of change between these two points.</li>
    <li>Take the limit of this expression as the point <span class="math">c</span> approaches <span class="math">b</span>.</li>
    <li>Simplify.</li>
  </ol>
  Evaluating <span class="math">f(x)</span> at <span class="math">b</span> and <span class="math">c</span> is easy. We
  are left with:
  <div class="math">
    \begin{aligned}
      f(b) = ab^n \\
      f(c) = ac^n.
    \end{aligned}
  </div>
  To determine the average rate of change between these points we use the familiar expression
  <span class="math">\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x}</span>. This gives:
  <div class="math">\frac{ac^n - ab^n}{c - b}.</div>
  Let's now take the limit as <span class="math">c</span> approaches <span class="math">b</span> (we'll also factor out
  the constant <span class="math">a</span> to simplify the expression):
  <div class="math">a \lim_{c \to b} \frac{c^n - b^n}{c - b}.</div>
  Here's where things get a bit hairier. We cannot straightaway take the limit as <span class="math">c</span> approaches
  <span class="math">b</span>, as that will leave us with zeros in both the numerator and denominator. Rather, we must
  use some cleverness to find a way to simplify this expression, ideally by removing the <span class="math">c-b</span>
  from the denominator. How might we do this? Well, if we can find a way to factor <span class="math">c-b</span> from
  <span class="math">c^n - b^n</span> in the numerator, then we could cancel the <span class="math">c-b</span>'s. This
  seems promising, so let's give it a go.
  <br><br>
  What type of expression must we multiply by <span class="math">c-b</span> in order to be left with
  <span class="math">c^n - b^n</span>? Certainly, it must contain terms <span class="math">c^{n-1}</span> and
  <span class="math">b^{n-1}</span>. However, it cannot be as simple as <span class="math">c^{n-1} + b^{n-1}</span>
  as that leaves us with
  <div class="math">(c-b)(c^{n-1} + b^{n-1}) = c^n - b^n + cb^{n-1} - bc^{n-1}.</div>
  How can we deal with those pesky extra terms? The idea is to introduce a bunch of additional terms that cancel all
  of them out. Without going to the trouble of explaining exactly where this expression came from (if you are curious,
  Google "difference of powers" or "binomial coefficient"), we are able to produce the following factor:
  <div class="math">c^n - b^n = (c-b)(c^{n-1} + bc^{n-2} + b^{2}c^{n-3} + ... + b^{n-3}c^{2} + b^{n-2}c + b^{n-1}).</div>
  Substituting this into the numerator and cancelling the <span class="math">c-b</span>'s:
  <div class="math">a \lim_{c \to b} c^{n-1} + bc^{n-2} + b^{2}c^{n-3} + ... + b^{n-3}c^{2} + b^{n-2}c + b^{n-1}.</div>
  We are now able to take the limit without the issue of dividing by zero. Doing so:
  <div class="math">a (b^{n-1} + b(b)^{n-2} + b^{2}(b)^{n-3} + ... + b^{n-3}(b)^{2} + b^{n-2}(b) + b^{n-1}).</div>
  It is now just a matter of simplifying this expression. Clearly, each of the terms in this expression can be simplified
  to <span class="math">b^{n-1}</span>. We are just left with the question of how many there are. This is not such a
  tricky question to answer. We can see that each term has a power of <span class="math">b</span> ranging from
  <span class="math">n-1</span> to <span class="math">0</span>. As there are <span class="math">n</span> numbers from
  <span class="math">0</span> to <span class="math">n-1</span>, there must be <span class="math">n</span> total
  <span class="math">b^{n-1}</span> terms. Adding these all up, we are left with
  <div class="math">a nb^{n-1}.</div>
  Replacing the specific value of <span class="math">b</span> with the variable <span class="math">x</span>, we are left
  with
  <div class="math">f'(x) = nax^{n-1}.</div>
  This is, of course, what we set out to prove! As the mathematicians say, Q.E.D.
  <div class="title-sm yellow">Final Thoughts</div>
  What you've read above, in my opinion, encapsulates all of the most fundamental basic elements of differential calculus.
  Naturally, if you want to apply these ideas to physical problems, you will find yourself dramatically under-equipped.
  There are many more techniques that are necessary to evaluate the derivatives of other types of equations, and the
  complexity of the techniques increases massively as the functions in question become more and more convoluted. However,
  the idea of approximating the derivative as the slope between two nearby points remains instructive even in far more
  complex contexts. Remember that.
